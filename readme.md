- **VirusTotal Integration**: Real-time threat intelligence with file hash lookup and upload scanning
- **Advanced Threat Scoring**: Weighted scoring system combining multiple analysis vectors
- **Professional PDF Reports**: Comprehensive downloadable reports with charts and detailed findings

### User Interface
- **Modern Professional Design**: Clean, light theme with intuitive navigation
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time progress tracking and result visualization
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for various screen sizes and professional environments
- **Comprehensive Results Display**: Multiple tabs for organized information presentation

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS styling
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and gauges
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab for professional report creation
- **File Analysis**: Custom Python modules for static analysis
- **API Integration**: VirusTotal API v3 for threat intelligence
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and display

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Valid VirusTotal API key (for threat intelligence features)

### Required Dependencies
```
streamlit
plotly
pandas
reportlab
python-magic
requests
```

### Configuration
1. Set your VirusTotal API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

2. Configure Streamlit (place in `.streamlit/config.toml`):
   ```toml
   [server]
   headless = true
   address = "0.0.0.0"
   port = 5000
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
```

### Analysis Workflow
1. **File Upload**: Choose any file for analysis in the File Analysis tab
2. **Static Analysis**: Configure analysis parameters and run comprehensive static analysis
3. **VirusTotal Scanning**: Check file hashes or upload files for cloud-based threat detection
4. **Results Review**: View detailed results in the Results Dashboard
5. **Report Generation**: Create professional PDF reports in the Reports tab

### Key Features

#### Static Analysis
- File hash calculation (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Shannon entropy calculation for encryption/packing detection
- String extraction with configurable parameters
- Pattern detection for URLs, IPs, emails, and suspicious content
- File metadata extraction and analysis

#### VirusTotal Integration
- File hash lookup against VirusTotal database
- File upload and scanning for new samples
- Comprehensive detection results from multiple antivirus engines
- Real-time threat intelligence and reputation scoring

#### Threat Scoring System
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm
- Weighted combination of static analysis and VirusTotal results
- Risk level categorization (Low, Medium, High)
- Detailed component-level scoring breakdowns

## Security Considerations

- All file analysis is performed in-memory without persistent storage
- API keys are managed through environment variables
- No code execution - purely static analysis approach
- Rate limiting compliance for external API services

## API Integration

### VirusTotal API v3
- File hash lookup: `GET /files/{hash}`
- File upload: `POST /files`
- Analysis results: `GET /analyses/{id}`
- Automatic rate limiting for free tier compliance

## Professional Use Cases

- Malware analysis and research
- Incident response and forensics
- Security assessment and auditing
- Threat hunting and intelligence gathering
- Educational cybersecurity training

## Deployment

The application is designed for professional deployment environments:
- Single-user analysis workstations
- Team collaboration environments
- Educational laboratory settings
- Research and development environments

## Architecture

### Modular Design
- `utils/file_analyzer.py`: Static file analysis engine
- `utils/virustotal_api.py`: VirusTotal API integration
- `utils/threat_scorer.py`: Advanced threat scoring system
- `utils/pdf_generator.py`: Professional report generation

### Data Flow
1. File upload and preprocessing
2. Static analysis execution
3. External threat intelligence gathering
4. Scoring and risk assessment
5. Results compilation and presentation
6. Report generation and export
