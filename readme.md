- **Animations**: Lottie animations with CSS fallbacks for enhanced user experience

### Backend Architecture
- **Main Application**: Flask-like Streamlit app (`app.py`) serving as the primary interface
- **Modular Design**: Utility modules organized in `utils/` directory for specific functionality
- **Analysis Pipeline**: Multi-stage analysis engine with threat scoring and reporting

### Data Processing
- **File Analysis**: Byte-level analysis with entropy calculation, signature detection, and pattern matching
- **Threat Scoring**: Weighted scoring system combining multiple analysis factors
- **Report Generation**: PDF and JSON report generation with professional formatting

## Key Components

### 1. Analysis Engine (`utils/analysis_engine.py`)
- **Purpose**: Core malware detection logic
- **Features**: 
  - Entropy analysis for detecting packed/encrypted content
  - File signature detection for format identification
  - Suspicious keyword and pattern detection
  - Configurable analysis parameters

### 2. VirusTotal Integration (`utils/virustotal.py`)
- **Purpose**: External threat intelligence via VirusTotal API
- **Features**:
  - File hash submission and scanning
  - Report retrieval with caching
  - Rate limiting and error handling
  - Fallback graceful degradation

### 3. Threat Scoring Engine (`utils/threat_scorer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Quantitative threat assessment
- **Features**:
  - Weighted multi-factor scoring algorithm
  - Threat level classification (CLEAN, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  - Detailed reasoning for score calculations
  - Configurable scoring weights

### 4. Report Generator (`utils/report_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Professional report generation
- **Features**:
  - PDF reports with custom styling using ReportLab
  - JSON export for programmatic access
  - Professional formatting with charts and tables
  - Executive summary generation

### 5. Animation System (`lottie_animations.py`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced user experience during scanning
- **Features**:
  - Lottie animation support with CSS fallbacks
  - Mobile-optimized animations
  - Multiple animation states (scanning, success, error)
  - Graceful degradation when animations unavailable

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User uploads file through Streamlit interface
2. **Initial Processing**: File is read into memory and basic metadata extracted
3. **Analysis Pipeline**:
   - Entropy calculation and statistical analysis
   - Pattern matching against known malware signatures
   - File format detection and validation
   - Suspicious indicator extraction
4. **External Scanning**: VirusTotal API integration for additional threat intelligence
5. **Threat Assessment**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm produces threat level
6. **Report Generation**: Results compiled into professional PDF/JSON reports
7. **Presentation**: Results displayed with interactive visualizations

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualization
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **ReportLab**: PDF generation

### Optional Integrations
- **VirusTotal API**: External threat intelligence (requires API key)
- **Lottie**: Animation support (with fallback)

### Security Considerations
- File processing in memory to avoid disk storage
- API key management for external services
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for external API calls

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit-compatible Python environment
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies managed through standard Python packaging
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for API keys and settings

### Production Considerations
- **Scalability**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
- **Security**: No persistent file storage, memory-only processing
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms with configurable timeouts
- **Monitoring**: Built-in error handling and logging

### Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries for mobile devices
- **Touch Interface**: Touch-friendly buttons and interactions
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile network conditions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Architecture Decisions

### Choice of Streamlit
- **Problem**: Need for rapid development of interactive web application
- **Solution**: Streamlit for Python-native web development
- **Rationale**: Allows focus on analysis logic rather than web development complexity
- **Trade-offs**: Less flexibility than traditional web frameworks, but much faster development

### Modular Utility Structure
- **Problem**: Maintain clean, testable, and maintainable code
- **Solution**: Separate utility modules for different concerns
- **Rationale**: Enables independent testing and development of components
- **Benefits**: Code reusability, easier debugging, clear separation of concerns

### Multi-Factor Threat Scoring
- **Problem**: Single indicators are insufficient for accurate threat assessment
- **Solution**: Weighted scoring system combining multiple analysis factors
- **Rationale**: More accurate threat detection through ensemble approach
- **Implementation**: Configurable weights allow tuning for different use cases

### Graceful Degradation Strategy
- **Problem**: External dependencies (VirusTotal, Lottie) may be unavailable
- **Solution**: Fallback implementations and error handling
- **Rationale**: Ensures core functionality remains available even with partial failures
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability and user experience
